## Description

Sasa buki (bamboo leaf shaped breath) is a term used by shakuhachi players to describe the  progression of a note from soft-to-loud and loud-to-soft so that the sound formed can be thought of as the shape of a leaf.  

This proposal is for the development of a web application that will receive, process and record audio input and provide real-time feedback to the user so that they may visualise the leaf-like qualities of their note. Individual and collective performance data will form the data source of an informative creative visualisation.
