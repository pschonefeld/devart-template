![Sample Playback](../project_images/p6.png?raw=true "Prototype")

## playback visualisation

Today will be building a prototype...I figure that if able to build something convincing in a day then the actual app will be buildable over a month or so. Just need to keep things simple, not only to keep the project workable, but also to keep in line with the inspiration of the project.

Goal 1 - playback visualisation

I'm using an SVG path to viusalise the recording of the sound sample. The basic algorithm is shown below and demonstrates that i'm building a path rather than a polygon shape...if the width of the path is great enough the shape will appear solid:

![drawing the path](../project_images/drawing.png?raw=true "drawing the path")

Now I apply this same approach to the playback of the sound (Chrome only - Chrome on android works too!)

Interesting, it seems that there are roughtly half as many samples saved (elements in the list) as there are buffers processed. No show stopper for now, but Will need to investigate.

Goal 2 - record and playback tone

let add some audio color...

Found a very good demo of an open source app for detecting pitch by Chris Wilson http://webaudiodemos.appspot.com/pitchdetect/index.html which will come in handy.

Example with pitch: http://vectorshapes.com/sasabuki/sasa_buki_p5.html
 
So the sound produced is glitchy and this is exactly what I want as a starting point. From here I would like to add some visual color to the sample display but given time constraint will need to put this off. SVG is very flexible and there are a sveral options here. 

Goal 3 - multiple sample playback

So now need to demonstrate that this can be used as an instrument and after several hours coding have something that i believe meets the brief... 

Instructions: 
1. In Chrome click 'start record' to collect your samples (can be voice instrument etc);
2. After you have a collection, play the samples back by clicking on them
Note: You can click on the same or other sample while one is playing.

Obviously a lot of work to do yet, but I sampled the poem 'The Daffodils' and played each word back in sequence and the result was very interesting. Promising for use in conjuction with the spoken word component of my proposal.


Tomorrow: last day :(
