## putting it out there

A confession:  I'm an artist, not an expert painter or anything like that, but someone who dedicates a significant amount of time to the practice of creating art (at least as much time as I do coding).  For me, art is not just the ability to paint, throw pots or write poetry, it is the ability to view the world in a certain way and to then express that view.  This project is personally exciting because here my code meets my art, but code plus art is just a vehicle ... where are we going is the big question ... what is the end work, the art? 

We know that this art work needs to be engaging and something that perhaps has never been done before...it needs to provide insight into a new technology-assisted way of viewing and experiencing the world. Importantly, it also needs to touch the soul.  At its heart, Sasa buki is about the simple beauty in nature -- the study of the form of a simple bamboo leaf that when joined with thousands will make a forest -- peaceful, powerful, potentially dark and ominous -- an expressway to spirit.

To maintain this theme of simplicity and yet make full use of Sasa buki sampled sounds, i believe a performance will be the most effective means of delivery.

I too realise that i'm going to have to put more effort into the prototype in order to demonstrate that this will work and that i'm not crazy and/or suffering delusions of grandeur!

## collaborative performance

I propose a performance component be a collaboration between the Sasa buki app and three performing artists. A poet, a shakuhachi player and an experimental instrumentalist.  The visualisation will provide generative, visual poetry to the performance that consists of three parts:

1. Poet - the poet reads a poem. Each word becomes sampled into Sasa buki -- a leaf in the performance forest; 

2. Musician - the shakuhachi player provides their interpretation of the poetry (and the traditional concept of sasa buki).  Each note of the instrument becomes a leaf in the forest.

[[while performing,  the words and notes of the poet and musician are visualised via a projection of the user interface display onto the wall]]

3. Musician + Generative - the poet’s performance is played back as samples in sequence accompanied by the sound of the shakuhachi. 

4. Musician - uses the Sasa buki samples generated by the other performances as notes in an improvisation piece that using the app's user interface as a musical instrument. 

Each perforamce will be unique and careful consideration of the number of performances would need to be made based on the cost of performers and made in consultation with the exhibition management. I propose that a single performance would suffice (although not ideal).

## installation

The hardware component of this project will be simple: For the performance a desk mounted touch screen ... for the non-performance component headphones and mic will be added to the desk mounted touch screen so that the visitor can experiment with the app (interaction is important!). It is intended that the display be projected (duplicated) onto a white wall/screen and depending on budgetary constraint another display would play the last live performance.

Tomorrow: the visualisation and more convincing prototype.
