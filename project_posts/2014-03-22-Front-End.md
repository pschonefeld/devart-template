So what does the Sas buki project do? What parts does it have? What tasks will be involved in its creation? If there’s one thing I’ve learnt over the years of developing software it is that before you write a line of code you need a concrete scope of work…once you have that scope, you’re able to break the work into tasks so you know where you are going and, importantly, get a sense of where you’ve been (the satisfaction of progress and meeting goals). 

I figure that the major output of this proposal (given my late start!) will be the development of this scope of work and associated task list, but before then an idea needs legs if it’s to run. Sasa buki’s has four legs:

1. the front end 
2. the server App 
3. the visualisation
4. the Installation

In this post i’ll overview the front end requirements and associtated tool sets.

We need an intuitive user interface that will make it easy for the user to input their sound and receive visual feedback.  There will need to be some calibration feature so that the app can be ‘trained’ to understand the nature of the input volume levels, default frequency etc. for voice or instrument. The app will also need some minor configuration (eg. change the time scale for the sample).

So who will use Sasa buki? As a web app anyone on the web should be able to use it … so targeting desktop, tablet and mobile. The actual vehicle of delivery will be the browser and so the first bit of kit for the project will be Google Chrome. If the project works in other browsers (as it should because will be using standard technologies) that’s great but, in my experience, Chrome provides the richest set of implemented standards so will the project will be targeting that browser.

So browser based means that HTML5, CSS and Javascript are in the mix, but I want the development experience and user experience to be the best possible. In this regard I’ll be adding SVG to the mix [1](from about 2003-2008 I specialised in SVG front end development so know a bit about this ;) and my secret (or not so secret) weapon will be the Dart programming language and development environment [2](i have over two years experience in this new language and my   http://vectorshapes.com site was realeased in August 2013 as the first production website on the internet all built with Dart).  Dart will compile to javascript and, I can tell ya, the code experience is far better than working directly with js or js libraries.  

I’d like to put in place a good design process so will be looking at using the Polymer Dart library for component development [3] and Angular Dart as a framework for the app [4]. 

Working with sound - I have to admit that this technology is new to me so early on will need to prototype working with Dart and the standard Web Audio API [5]. As part of this proposal I will prototype receiving sound sample and recording volume and frequency.

User authentication - if Sasa buki is to be effective the user will need to log in and store their session data. I’ve had success with oauth and the Google+ Sign-I n API [6] so would use this as the the apps authentication system.

So now I have a way forward for the Sasa buki front end + an exciting toolkit:

Google Chrome
SVG
Dart
Polymer Dart
Angular Dart
Google+ Sign-In

Tomorrow: The front end prototype.
